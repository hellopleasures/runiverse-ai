# Register your app in Ronin Wallet's Trusted Domain System (TDS)

## Overview[‚Äã](/ronin/wallet/guides/tds#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The Ronin Wallet's Trusted Domain System (TDS) categorizes apps into various trust levels based on the reputation of their developers. Each level has a corresponding font color and badge that indicates the app's trustworthiness.

For game and dApp developers building on Ronin, registering your app in the TDS is essential to ensure that users can trust your app and interact with it safely. Registered apps are categorized as "Mavis' Friends," which assures users that these apps are safe to use. Unregistered apps may be categorized as "Unknown," which could inadvertently deter users from engaging with them due to perceived security concerns.

## Steps[‚Äã](/ronin/wallet/guides/tds#steps "Direct link to Steps")

### Step 1. Understand trust levels[‚Äã](/ronin/wallet/guides/tds#step-1-understand-trust-levels "Direct link to Step 1. Understand trust levels")

#### Mavis' dApp[‚Äã](/ronin/wallet/guides/tds#mavis-dapp "Direct link to Mavis' dApp")

Projects that are built and deployed by Sky Mavis or Ronin are given a "Mavis' dApp" badge. Users can feel safe interacting with these apps.

#### Mavis' Friends[‚Äã](/ronin/wallet/guides/tds#mavis-friends "Direct link to Mavis' Friends")

Projects that are built by business partners of Sky Mavis or Ronin are given a "Mavis' Friend" badge. This is the highest trust level for third-party apps, and the level you get after registering your app in the TDS.

#### Unverified apps[‚Äã](/ronin/wallet/guides/tds#unverified-apps "Direct link to Unverified apps")

Projects that haven't been registered in the TDS are indicated as unverified, using a yellow font and an exclamatory mark. Users are advised to proceed with caution when interacting with these apps.

#### Banned apps[‚Äã](/ronin/wallet/guides/tds#banned-apps "Direct link to Banned apps")

To register your app in the TDS, submit your app's information by opening a pull request in the [Ronin Ecosystem Projects](https://github.com/ronin-chain/ronin-ecosystem-projects) repository. For more information, refer to the repository's README file.

### Step 3. Wait for approval[‚Äã](/ronin/wallet/guides/tds#step-3-wait-for-approval "Direct link to Step 3. Wait for approval")

After your submission is approved and processed by the Sky Mavis team, your app will be assigned a "Mavis' Friends" badge in Ronin Wallet.
